# I am many things.

A writer, gamer, autist, learner, coder, worldbuilder, christian, lover, in no particular order.

## Projects
Currently I'm very excited about my pet project - [Yvari](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/yvari-imoenkim).

Yvari started as a crazy idea when it occured to me I wanted to try my hand on gamedev. If you want to learn it, what better way to do so on a personal project? And clearly you can't use an existing franchise, so I had to invent my own.

These days I spend a lot of time in the [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/WHuu4qH) belonging to the amazing community of [World Anvil]. The site facilitated the actual work on this crazy idea a lot, and without it and its community it would probably still be a crazy idea.

For now, I'm content with Yvari being all about stories, and I'm working on honing my writing skills on it. At some point, though, I hope to develop an RPG system for Yvari, and right now I'm debating whether to actually write a book or an adventure arc with the main story floating in my head.

## Partners
Currently I'm working on Yvari on my own, but there are plans for my SO to chime in and contribute to the project.
